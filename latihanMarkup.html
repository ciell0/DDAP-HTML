                        No more appointment-scheduling phone tag! Instead, allow veterinary clients to request appointments in the time blocks you choose. These requests dont write back into your PIMS, giving your staff the flexibility to approve the appointment, or suggest alternate times if the client selects a time slot that doesnt work.

                        When people lead busy lives, its hard to remember their own appointments, much less those for their pets. With text, email, postcards, and push notification reminders, the rate of missed appointments will plummet! Use Healthypet automated reminder system to connect in ways that matter with custom messages and offers.
